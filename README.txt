This Banking Simulation Project is a software application developed to simulate the basic operations of a banking system. The main objective of this project is to understand how real-world banking functions work and to implement them using programming concepts.
This project allows users to create an account, log in securely deposite money, withdraw funds check account balance, and view transaction details. user data is stored in a databse,ensuring proper record management and data consistency.
The system includes authentication features such as OTP verification and password validation to enhance security.Error handeling and input validation are implemented to prevent transactions and unauthrized access.
This project is developed using Python for backend logic and SQL/SQLite for database management. A user-friendly interface (Tkinter) is provided for smooth interactions. 
  You need to replace app password of your gmail account in EmailHandler.py file. later on kindly delete the same due to security purposes.
Overall this project helps in gaining practical Knowledge of database operations, backend logic, security concepts, and real-time transactions handling, making it useful for learning software development and banking system fundamentals.
